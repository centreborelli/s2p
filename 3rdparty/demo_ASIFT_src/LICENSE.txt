The source code files in this directory implement as tightly as 
possible algorithms described in this IPOL article. They are made 
available to the exclusive aim of serving as scientific tools enabling 
the verification of the soundness and completeness of the algorithmic 
descriptions.

These source codes implement an algorithm possibly linked to the patent 
[1][2]. Compiling or running this code may violate patents in certain 
countries. For this reason, the use of the source files 
- demo_ASIFT.cpp
- compute_asift_keypoints.cpp
- compute_asift_matches.cpp
- demo_lib_sift.cpp
may be restricted in certain countries to non profit research and non profit 
educational purposes. In certain countries, redistribution or commercial 
use of these source files may require the  consent of the patent owner.

affine recognition recognition of shapes (WO/2009/150361), patent pending.

features in an image and use of same for locating an object in an 
image",  U.S. Patent 6,711,293.

In short, be careful before you download, compile, use, modify, or 
redistribute these source codes. The situation being different for every 
country and changing over time, it is your responsibility to check that 
you are not infringing a patent by using this source code. IPOL therefore 
invites potential users to consult a patent lawyer. If and only if you are
free from any patent restriction, then you can enjoy the BSD license terms.

The source code in the subdirectory third_party comes from the Eigen 
library, which is LGPL-licensed.
