sift_anatomy_20140609.tar.gz
 - Review Pascal Getreuer part 2.

// 20140609
- Bug in the normalization of the feature vector.
This is not bin*255/max(bins) but bin*512/norml2(bins)

// 20140611
- sqrt(2) replace by a define
- bug in assert tests comparing floats that can be equal
  correction use FLOAT_EPSILON to include the equality case.
  in lib_descriptor in assert M_PI
- M_PI was defined twice with various number of decimals
- fmod to express the gradient in 0 2pi (atan2 gives in -pi pi)
   the problem fmod(x+10*M_PI,2*M_PI) -> fmod(x+2*M_PI,2*M_PI)
- Extrema interpolation. Possible difference between anatomy and lowe binaries.
  If the offset in scale is larger than 0.5 (the half distance between two
  scale samples) Lowe doesn't (I believe) jump to the next scale. Only, change
  sin position are implemented.  Observations: With this sampling parameters
  the threshold over the offset has an impact on the keypoint location (number
  of keypoints position) Visually, our results are more similar to Lowe's if we
  don't

// 20140616
 - in a few assert. replaced FLT_FLOAT with a larger constant EPSILON.
 - in lib_util linear_conversion : response in [0,1]. skip the normalization if the vector
   is constant (0 division)
 - array_max
 - array_min
 - find_array_max
 - fixed index in description  (s+1) -> s. This is the index used to chose the
   layer of the octace (gradient).

// 20140618
 - bug, find two first minima of an array
 - new functions in lib_util.c (euclidean_distance  euclidean_distance_square)
 - TODO, the comparison should be performed on the squared euclidean distance
   (for speed and precision).  tested it gives the same result than euclidean
   distance and exactly the same result as Lowe's code (siftDemoV4/match.c).

// 20140630
 - in lib_sift.c replace hardcoded default parameters with a call to the
   sift_assign_default_parameters function
 - in demo_extract_patch.c  remove printImage definition
 - in demo_extract_patch.c  function thumbnail_ori rewritten
 - in demo_extract_patch.c  remove not used functions gradient_field_ori() and
   gradient_field_descr()
 - sprintf() is replaced with snprintf() The functions snprintf() and
   vsnprintf() write at most size bytes (including the terminating null byte
   ('\0')) to str.
 - remove 'count' output for functions accumulating histograms,
   sift_extract_feature_vector and sift_accumulate_orientation_histogram,
   they now return void

// 20140801 - Major change in the interface
 sift_cli
 - new parameter parser pick_option() (inspired by enric's implementation).
 - each parameter is adjustable individually
 - the help menu and README are changed accordingly
 TODO:
 - add an option to do only detection
 - remove a few useless output files (extra_????.txt), namely ..REJ.. ..MULT..
 - euclidean_distance() uses euclidean_distance()
 - replace ceil by floor+1 !!! in lib_description.

// 20140808 _Leo_F_
 - new function fprintf_one_keypoint(). This will guaranty consistency between sift_cli and match_cli.
 - refactoring match_cli, the useless 'pair' structure is replaced by three sift_keypoints structure and a list of doubles
 - sift_keypoints structure: the list of pointers to keypoint structures is replaced by a list of keypoints.

// 20140819
 - fixed BUG segmentation fault (realloc_sift_keypoints - bad comparison size and capacity)
 - fixed memory leaks in filtering question (the copy of the keypoint was allocated regardeless of the test results)
 - fixed BUG affecting sift_find_ori_and_fill_descriptors and sift_anatomy_orientation_and_description:
         sx instead of sy in keypoints_attribute_one_orientation

// 20140901
 - two example codes that use the lib_sift.o: example.c and sift_cli_standard.c
   (requested by the reviewer)
 - unnecessary casts from (void*), as in the return value of malloc, can be
   avoided.
 - UNDONE printing the keypoints starting with keypoints with the largest
   scale.
 - FIXED BUG in the orientation histogram peak interpolation. The wrong formula
   led to a quantified set of principal orientations.

// 20140909
 - computation of number of octave (now put aside in a static function)
 - threshold adaptation to scalespace discretization (now put aside in a static function)


// 20140911
 - update io_png.c (it includes the string.h library that defines strcmp).
 - anatomy2lowe script to convert orientations and descriptors
 - FIXED BUG in match_cli, a segfault was raised in the absence of any match.
 - Check if all input filenames are valid
